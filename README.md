# kirby-newsletter-addon
this will add a newsletter functionality to kirby

## note
I am by no means a developer in PHP or web stuff.
I post the code and files I created since I have no idea on how to move on with this. I believe I won't even get along with bugs, and issue fixing. Count this as an initial online store for further development.

Perhaps you can grab the code and develop it to a decent newsletter addon for kirby :)

## config
